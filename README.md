âœ… **Reporting & Analytics** â€“ Generate detailed reports on daily, weekly, and monthly sales.  
âœ… **Invoice & Receipt Printing** â€“ Issue receipts with customizable templates.

âœ… **Offline Support** â€“ Works independently without an internet connection.  
âœ… **Database Synchronization** â€“ Optionally sync menu data with the **leackerdeal.de** website.  
âœ… **PayPal Payment Integration** â€“ Planned for future implementation.  

## Technologies Used  
- **C# (.NET Framework)** â€“ Core programming language  
- **Windows Forms (WinForms)** â€“ UI framework for desktop application  
- **MSSQL (Local Database)** â€“ Database system with stored procedures  
- **ADO.NET** â€“ Direct database communication  
- **Microsoft Dependency Injection (DI)** â€“ Used for managing services  
- **Layered Architecture (BEL, BAL, DAL)** â€“ Structured to separate business logic, database access, and UI processing  

## Project Architecture  
The system follows a **layered architecture** for better maintainability and scalability:

### **1. Business Entities Layer (BEL)**  
Defines the **data models** used across the application. Examples:  
- `Invoice.cs` â€“ Stores invoice details  
- `InvoiceItem.cs` â€“ Manages ordered products  
- `Settings.cs` â€“ Stores application settings  

### **2. Business Application Layer (BAL)**  
Handles **business logic** and communicates with **DAL**. Examples:  
- `CafeMenuCategoryService.cs` â€“ Manages menu categories  
- `SettingsService.cs` â€“ Handles system settings  

### **3. Data Access Layer (DAL)**  
Manages **database operations (CRUD)** using ADO.NET and stored procedures. Examples:  
- `InvoiceRepository.cs` â€“ Handles invoice-related database queries  
- `SettingsRepository.cs` â€“ Manages application settings in the database
